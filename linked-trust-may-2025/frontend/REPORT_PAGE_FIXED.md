# Report Page Fixed!

## The Issue
The report page wasn't displaying properly because:
1. The backend returns `subjectEntity` and `objectEntity` as `null`
2. But the entity information IS available in the `edges` array

## The Solution
Updated the ClaimReport component to:
1. Extract entity information from the edges array
2. Display the subject name from `edges[0].startNode.name`
3. Show the entity type badge using `edges[0].startNode.entType`
4. Display the source name from `edges[1].endNode.name`

## What the Report Page Now Shows

### Main Claim Details Card
- **Subject**: Shows "AMURT Disaster Relief â€“ Development Cooperation" with ORGANIZATION badge
- **Claim Type**: "impact"
- **Statement**: The full statement about AMURT's work in Nigeria
- **Date**: May 3, 2024
- **Confidence**: 85%
- **How Known**: SECOND HAND
- **Source**: Link to "Safeguarding lives of women & children"

### Validation Summary
- Shows chips for Agrees/Disagrees/Confirms/Refutes (all 0 in this case)

### Related Claims
- Shows the other claim about AMURT with 5 stars rating
- Each related claim has a "View" button to navigate to its report

## Key Improvements
1. **Proper entity display** - Uses edge data when entity objects are null
2. **Clean layout** - Cards with proper spacing and typography
3. **Interactive elements** - Clickable source links and view buttons
4. **Entity badges** - Shows ORGANIZATION, PERSON, etc. badges
5. **Star ratings** - Displays star ratings for claims that have them

The report page is now fully functional and displays all the claim data properly!
