# Final TypeScript Fix

## Fixed the Last Error in RenderClaimDetails

### Issue:
The `RenderClaimDetails` component had its own `Claim` interface that expected `subject` to be a string, but we were passing a `LocalClaim` with `subject` as either string or Entity object.

### Solution:
1. Updated the `Claim` interface in `RenderClaimDetails.tsx` to match the actual data structure
2. Added logic to properly display Entity subjects - showing the name if available, otherwise the URI

### Code Changes:
- Updated interface to handle both string and Entity object for subject
- Added display logic to extract name from Entity objects when rendering

Now when displaying a claim with an Entity subject like:
```json
{
  "subject": {
    "uri": "https://example.com/user/123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "type": "PERSON"
  }
}
```

It will display "John Doe" instead of showing the whole object.

## All TypeScript errors should now be resolved!

Run `yarn tsc --noEmit` to verify compilation works.
