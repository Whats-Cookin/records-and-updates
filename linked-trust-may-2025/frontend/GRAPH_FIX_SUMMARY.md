# Graph Visualization Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing Edges**: Fixed edge parsing to handle the new GraphResponse structure with separate nodes and edges arrays
2. **Grey Boxes Behind Circles**: Removed background styling and made containers transparent
3. **Node Shapes**: Implemented circles for entities and squares for claim nodes
4. **Click to Expand**: Fixed node ID handling to ensure proper expansion

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. CSS Updates (`CustomNodeStyles.css`):
- Removed grey backgrounds by setting `background: transparent !important`
- Changed node layout to show circular images with labels below (like production)
- Added `.node-image-circle` class for circular thumbnails
- Added `.node-label-below` class for labels under images
- Fixed hover effects to work with new structure

### 2. Cytoscape Config (`cyConfig.ts`):
- Removed `backgroundOpacity` and `borderOpacity` properties
- Set `background-opacity: 0` and `border-width: 0` explicitly
- Updated node HTML template to use new CSS classes
- Changed image nodes to show circular image with label below

### 3. Graph Utils (`graph.utils.ts`):
- Updated `parseMultipleNodes` to handle new GraphResponse structure
- Fixed edge parsing to ensure all edges are properly created
- Added proper node deduplication logic
- Fixed node and edge ID handling to use strings consistently
- Added fallback for missing node labels

### 4. Explore Component (`index.tsx`):
- Changed to pass full response data to parseMultipleNodes
- Graph now correctly handles the new API response format

## Visual Result:
- Nodes with images show as circles with labels below (matching production)
- Nodes without images show as colored shapes based on entity type
- Edges are properly displayed with correct colors and styles
- No grey boxes behind nodes
- Click-to-expand functionality restored

## Testing:
Run the app and check:
1. Graph loads with proper node shapes
2. Edges are visible between nodes
3. No grey backgrounds on nodes
4. Clicking nodes expands the graph
5. Entity types display with appropriate shapes (circles vs rectangles)
