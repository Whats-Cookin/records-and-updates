# LinkedTrust Credential Display Implementation

## What We've Built

### 1. **CredentialCertificate Component** (`/components/CredentialCertificate.tsx`)
- Beautiful certificate-style display adapted from the saved_from_dev design
- Shows achievement badge/icon
- Displays recipient name, achievement name, description
- Shows skills/tags as chips
- Displays criteria section
- Shows issuer with verified badge
- Includes endorsements from related claims
- Export to PDF functionality
- Share on LinkedIn functionality
- Responsive design

### 2. **CredentialView Container** (`/containers/CredentialView.tsx`)
- Fetches credential from API using URI
- Handles loading and error states
- Displays the credential certificate

### 3. **CredentialCard Component** (`/components/CredentialCard.tsx`)
- Compact and full card views for credentials
- Shows achievement icon based on type
- Displays key info: name, issuer, date
- Skills preview with "+N more" for overflow
- Share functionality
- Navigate to full certificate view

### 4. **CredentialFeed Component** (`/components/CredentialFeed.tsx`)
- Fetches credentials from the feed
- Toggle between list and grid views
- Filters for credential claims (HAS predicate)
- Fetches full credential data for display

## Integration Steps Needed

### 1. **Add Routes**
In your router configuration (App.tsx or routes file):
```typescript
import CredentialView from './containers/CredentialView';

// Add route
<Route path="/credentials/:uri" element={<CredentialView />} />
```

### 2. **Update Navigation**
Add credential section to your navigation/menu:
```typescript
<MenuItem onClick={() => navigate('/credentials')}>
  Credentials
</MenuItem>
```

### 3. **Add to Main Feed**
Integrate credentials into the main feed by detecting credential claims:
```typescript
// In your main feed component
const isCredentialClaim = (claim) => {
  return claim.claim === 'HAS' && 
    (claim.object?.includes('credential') || 
     claim.object?.startsWith('urn:credential:'));
};

// Show CredentialCard for credential claims
{isCredentialClaim(claim) ? (
  <CredentialCard credential={fetchedCredential} />
) : (
  <RegularClaimCard claim={claim} />
)}
```

### 4. **Add API Service Method** (if not exists)
```typescript
// In apiService.ts
export const apiService = {
  get: (url: string) => axios.get(`${BACKEND_URL}${url}`),
  // ... other methods
};
```

### 5. **Import Missing Assets**
- Copy badge.svg from saved_from_dev/assets if needed
- Or use a different badge/seal image

## Visual Design Features

### Certificate View Features:
- **Formal Design**: Professional certificate appearance
- **Badge/Seal**: Visual authority symbol
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Clear information hierarchy
- **Color Scheme**: Uses LinkedTrust green (#2D6A4F)
- **Responsive**: Adapts to all screen sizes
- **Print-Ready**: Exports cleanly to PDF

### Card View Features:
- **Compact Mode**: For list views
- **Full Mode**: For grid views
- **Type Icons**: Visual distinction by credential type
- **Quick Actions**: Share, view details
- **Skill Preview**: Shows top skills with overflow indicator

## API Requirements (Already Working âœ…)

The backend already supports:
- `GET /api/credentials/:uri` - Fetch credential by URI
- Returns credential data + related claims
- Display hints in metadata guide UI rendering

## Next Steps

1. **Test Integration**: Add routes and test the components
2. **Style Adjustments**: Tweak colors/fonts to match your theme
3. **Add Animations**: Smooth transitions for better UX
4. **Search/Filter**: Add credential search functionality
5. **Credential Creation**: Link to linked-Creds-author for creating new credentials

## Benefits

- **Beautiful Display**: Professional certificate appearance
- **Shareable**: LinkedIn integration and link sharing
- **Exportable**: PDF generation for offline use
- **Responsive**: Works on all devices
- **Discoverable**: Integrated into the main feed
- **Linked**: Part of the trust graph with endorsements

The implementation reuses the beautiful certificate design from saved_from_dev while adapting it for W3C Verifiable Credentials. This gives you both a formal certificate view for sharing/printing and compact card views for feeds/lists.
