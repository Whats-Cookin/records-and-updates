│   │   └── CredentialCertificate.tsx  ✅ (MAIN - uses existing styles)
│   ├── CredentialCard.tsx             ✅ (NEW - for feed/list views)

└── containers/
    └── CredentialView.tsx              ✅ (NEW - page component)
```

## What We're Using

### 1. **CredentialCertificate** (`components/credential/CredentialCertificate.tsx`)
- **Status**: Already exists, properly integrated
- **Features**:
  - Uses existing certificate design and styles
  - Imports SharePopover and CertificateMedia from certificate components
  - Uses certificateStyles constants
  - Displays W3C Verifiable Credentials in certificate format
  - Handles OpenBadge achievements, skills, portfolio
  - Export to PDF and LinkedIn sharing

### 2. **CredentialView** (`containers/CredentialView.tsx`)
- **Status**: Created, import path updated
- **Purpose**: Page component that fetches and displays a credential
- **Route**: `/credentials/:uri`

### 3. **CredentialCard** (`components/CredentialCard.tsx`)
- **Status**: Created
- **Purpose**: Compact and full card views for credentials in feeds
- **Features**:
  - Compact mode for lists
  - Full mode for grid views
  - Type-based icons and colors
  - Quick share and view actions

### 4. **CredentialFeed** (`components/CredentialFeed.tsx`)
- **Status**: Created
- **Purpose**: Display a feed of credentials
- **Features**:
  - Toggle between list/grid views
  - Fetches credentials from claims API
  - Uses CredentialCard for display

## Integration Steps

### 1. Add Route
In `App.tsx` or your routes configuration:
```typescript
import CredentialView from './containers/CredentialView';

<Route path="/credentials/:uri" element={<CredentialView />} />
```

### 2. Check API Service
Make sure `apiService` is properly configured in `src/api/apiService.ts`

### 3. Test the Flow
- Navigate to `/credentials/{credential-uri}`
- Should fetch from `/api/credentials/{uri}`
- Display beautiful certificate

### 4. Add to Navigation
Add a credentials section to your navigation menu

### 5. Integrate with Feed
In your main feed, detect credential claims and show CredentialCard

## The Good News

- The existing `credential/CredentialCertificate.tsx` is already well-integrated
- It uses all the existing styles and components
- The backend API is ready
- We have both certificate (formal) and card (compact) views

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Duplicate**: Delete `src/components/CredentialCertificate.tsx` (the one I created)
2. **Test Integration**: Add the route and test with a real credential URI
3. **Feed Integration**: Update main feed to show credentials using CredentialCard
4. **Add Search**: Create credential search/filter functionality
