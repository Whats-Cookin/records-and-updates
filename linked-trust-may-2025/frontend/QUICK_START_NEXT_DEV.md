# Quick Start for Next Developer

## What Was Done Today
1. Updated entire frontend to work with new LinkedClaims API
2. All endpoints changed from v1/v2/v3 to clean REST endpoints
3. Field names updated (rating‚Üíscore, amount‚Üíamt)
4. Entity system implemented with badges
5. Fixed all TypeScript build errors

## Current State
- ‚úÖ App builds and deploys
- ‚úÖ Core features working (feed, create claim, graph, reports)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Code needs cleanup but is functional
- üîß Some TypeScript compromises made to fix build quickly

## If You Need to Continue

### Check These Files First:
1. `FRONTEND_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md` - Detailed progress log
2. `CLEANUP_PLAN.md` - Next steps for code cleanup
3. `README_API_UPDATE.md` - Summary of API changes

### Key Files Created/Modified:
- `/src/api/` - New API service layer
- `/src/types/entities.ts` - Entity type system
- `/src/components/EntityBadge/` - Entity badges

### Known Issues:
1. Feed component is too large (600+ lines)
2. Mixed type definitions (some legacy, some new)
3. Ceramic/ComposeDB code still present but unused
4. Some `any` type assertions used for quick fixes

### Quick Commands:
```bash
yarn install
yarn dev      # Start dev server
yarn build    # Build for production
yarn preview  # Preview production build
```

### If Build Fails:
- Check `/src/api/types.ts` - May need to add more legacy fields
- Look for type mismatches between local and API types
- Ensure all nullable fields are handled properly

Good luck! The hard part (API migration) is done. Now it just needs cleanup.
