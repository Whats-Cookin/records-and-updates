# Ceramic Cleanup Summary

## Dependencies to Remove from package.json:
```
"@ceramicnetwork/common": "^2.24.0",
"@ceramicnetwork/http-client": "^2.20.0",
"@composedb/client": "0.4.0",
"@composedb/types": "0.4.0",
"@didtools/pkh-ethereum": "^0.1.0",
"did-session": "^1.0.0",
```

## Files/Directories Removed:
- ✅ /src/composedb/ (entire directory)
- ✅ Ceramic code from useCreateClaim.ts
- ✅ Ceramic functions from authUtils.ts
- ✅ CERAMIC_URL from settings.ts

## Code Changes Made:
1. **useCreateClaim.ts**
   - Removed ceramic imports
   - Removed PublishClaim logic
   - Removed canSignClaims check
   - Now only uses backend API

2. **authUtils.ts**
   - Removed ceramic imports
   - Removed initializeDIDAuth function
   - Removed canSignClaims function
   - Kept JWT auth functions

## To Complete Cleanup:
1. Run: `yarn remove @ceramicnetwork/common @ceramicnetwork/http-client @composedb/client @composedb/types @didtools/pkh-ethereum did-session`
2. Delete the composedb_DELETED directory permanently
3. Remove from .env file:
   - VITE_CERAMIC_URL
   - VITE_DID_PRIVATE_KEY (if only used for ceramic)

## Benefits:
- Smaller bundle size
- Fewer dependencies to maintain
- Cleaner codebase
- No more ceramic-related errors
