# Report Page Fix Summary

## Problem
1. Validations (claims about claims) were not showing up on the report page
2. Images associated with validations were missing

## Root Cause
The validation claims have subjects that point to the claim URI, but the URI format wasn't being matched correctly. The backend was only looking for one specific URI format, but the actual claims in the database might use different formats (claim vs claims vs report).

## Solution
1. **Fixed validation query**: Now checks multiple possible URI formats when looking for validations:
   - `/claims/{id}`
   - `/claim/{id}`
   - `/report/{id}`
   - With different domain variations (linkedtrust.us, dev.linkedtrust.us, live.linkedtrust.us)

2. **Added image support**: The validations now include image URLs from the Node table's image field

3. **Kept it simple**: Validations are just claims - no special handling needed beyond finding claims where the subject matches the claim URI

## Code Changes
In `src/api/report.ts`:
- Modified the validation query to check multiple URI formats using `subject: { in: possibleUris }`
- Added transformation to include image URLs from the node's image field
- Added logging to help debug which URIs are being checked

## Testing
Run the backend and test with:
```bash
node test-report.js
```

Or use curl:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/api/report/118499
```

The response should now include validations with their associated images.
